#This NLP project targets at analyzing the similarities between two groups of sentences (which can be seen in test.csv). 

#Firstly I utilized NLTP to tokenize the sentence, I also suggest using spacy to help tokenize.

#Secondly by transforming the sentence into vectors through Word2vec, I am able to generate many features (various distances) based on the vectors.
#Fuzzywuzzy was also very useful in providing significant feature and I believe including sentimental analysis will lead to a better result

#Lastly I built XGboost Model based on these features. By applying cross validation and parameter tuning. The model achieve a result of accuracy as 84%
